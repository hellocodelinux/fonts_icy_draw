## About TDF Fonts üñãÔ∏è
TDF (TheDraw Font) fonts are used to create text art and are compatible with both THEDRAW and ICY_DRAW. These fonts allow you to create intricate designs and text art with ease.

## About ICY_DRAW ‚ùÑÔ∏è
**ICY_DRAW** is a modern tool for creating text art, inspired by classic tools like THEDRAW. It supports TDF fonts and provides a user-friendly interface for creating and editing text art.

### IcyDraw
IcyDraw is the successor of MysticDraw, an ANSI drawing tool developed in 1996 and last updated in 2003. Due to a lack of feedback, interest was lost. Now, 20 years later, it has been updated and re-released as IcyDraw.

IcyDraw is a full-featured ANSI drawing tool that does things a bit differently than other tools.
